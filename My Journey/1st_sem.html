	<h1>MyFour Year Journey in REC Kannauj</h1>

	<h3>Welcome to my first semester journey.....</h3>

	<div>
		<h2>26 Jul 2017, Wednesday</h2>
		It was the day when I get admission in my college. One evening before that day, I and my dad started our journey to the college through train. That train (Utsarg Express) was the only train to Kannauj from my home town and It was about 12 hour journey. I want to say something that before my counselling, I never heard the name of Kannauj and where the place is. But that day I was very excited that I am going to future college and will make new friends. The time of train was 10:53 in morning to reach Kannauj but it arrived there at 01:00pm in noon. We had to reach <b>Tirwaganj</b> which was 18 km far from the railway station. We take an auto rickshaw which was going to Tirwaganj and I saw that it was full of the students who were wanted to go to the same place. In between the way, auto rickshaw stopped somewhere I saw a college, it was beautiful and big I thought that it was mine college but badly it was Government medical college, Tirwa.<br>
		<img src="Photos/5.jpg">
		We reached the college and saw some under construction building and some constructed. My admission was going in room no 205. After got admission we went to see the hostel. Hostel‚Äôs Room no <b>202</b> was allocated to me. We see the whole campus but it was not like that as I expected in my dreams how my college should be. While we were leaving a lady came to me and asked, ‚Äúhow is the college?‚Äù. I hesitated and replied that it was beautiful and good. Then I thought that I had seen her somewhere, I remembered and realised that I saw her picture on my college website. She was my college director <b>Dr. Neelam Shrivastava</b>. Also I met my first college friend here, his name was <b>Suhail Iqbal</b>. He also came there with his dad. We shared phone numbers and get introduced each other. We both had allotted hostel room together, his room was 203. The classes were decided to start by 10th Aug. So we came back to Kannauj to take bus to Kanpur and then from Kanpur to home. <b>Suhail</b> and his dad came with us till Tirwaganj and then they went to Moradabad.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>20 Aug 2017, Sunday</h2>
		<img src="Photos/6.jpg">
		It was the day when I came back to college hostel to stay there. College has started from 10th August but I was late because I had some fever and also don‚Äôt want to go that college. But I had to go.  We (Me and dad) came here by same train and this time it was not late. We came to hostel and my dad talk to warden <b>Santosh Sir</b> then I entered to my room. There I saw a guy was lying in my room. He was <b>Tahsin Khan</b>. He was not my roommate and he also belonged to Ballia. Tahsin went out and called my roommates. They were <b>Saurabh Kushwaha(CE), Rohit Singh(CE) and Prateek Dubey(CS)</b>. Prateek was playing Cricket at college that time, Satyam Singh phone called him and talk with the sound like warden sir and say to come immediately. There were only three wardrobes in every room in the hostel. And all three were occupied by them. Now the question arises that where would I put my clothes and all things. Then, all my future friends/hostel neighbours <b>(Satyam Singh, Shiv Shakti Rai, Vivekanand, Sujeet Kumar, Tahsin Khan, Neeraj Singh)</b> came to my room and negotiate with my roommates to share the wardrobe with me. After a long argument Saurabh decided to share his Almira with me. <b>Prateek</b> was talking  to everyone with toxic language like abusive word in every sentence. I belong to the family where abusing is bad manner and till then none of my friend was like <b>Prateek</b>. I decided that I will not make him friend.<br>
		<img src="Photos/7.jpg">
		When everything was sorted out then I and Dad went to Tirwa market to buy all daily needs, fruits, and some notebooks and had lunch there at <b>Shukla Restaurant</b>. My dad stayed in hostel for that day because returning ticket was on next day. Next day in morning dad bless me and told to make friends, don‚Äôt quarrel here with anyone, study by heart and many more things and then leave the hostel to go home.<br>
		<b>Rohit Singh</b> is student of civil engineering. He is from Balrampur and he was class representative in the first two semesters. In the hostel, he mostly lived alone and studied alone in the common hall. He was not too much friendly with our roommates. <b>Saurabh Kushwaha</b> is also student of civil engineering and he is from Kanpur. He was also good in computer programming knowledge but didn‚Äôt take that branch. Saurabh was too much friendly with the hostellers and he is slightly aggressive too, he had fight with some boys during first year. He is very good in study and he also plays too many mobile games. <b>Prateek Dubey</b> is from Azamgarh and he is the student of Computer Science & Engineering. He is a very tall, funny, helping and athletic boy. He plays a lot of games and sports. He sleeps too much, if there is holiday then he can sleep whole day, I can say that it‚Äôs his talent.<br>
		I don‚Äôt know how <b>Prateek</b> became my one of best friend in college. There are a lot of dissimilarities between us. He is a tall boy and I am short. He is aggressive and speaks loud and I am a shy and slow speaking boy. He is a night awake and I am early riser. He is slightly lazy and I am more active and also many more differences. But he is a sweet guy.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>21 Aug 2017, Monday</h2>
		It was my first day in college. I was so much excited and ready to enjoy my first day in college. I asked <b>Suhail Iqbal</b> that when he would go to college, take me with him. We went college and the first class was scheduled for Engineering Mathematics, <b>Swati Mishra</b> ma‚Äôam was taking class. Although, I missed the early classes so I couldn‚Äôt understand anything. I asked to a skinny, tall boy sat beside me, named <b>Siddharth Mishra</b>, ‚Äúwhich topic is going on‚Äù. He told me everything and promised me to teach me my missed topics. After that <b>Ankit Pathak sir</b> came to teach C Programming and there was no class further that day. We came back and take my first lunch in the mess. That day I made one more friend in college after <b>Suhail</b>, he was <b>Siddharth</b>. Siddharth was very intelligent student in every subjects and he was also very good in Badminton.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>22 Aug 2017, Tuesday</h2>
		That day was holiday (I don‚Äôt remember why) and my roommates <b>Prateek & Saurabh</b> woke up at 11:00 am. I usually wake up early in the morning. That day I also wake but I was feeling lonely and sad because I was missing my parents and home. I made phone call to my mom and talk about 2 hours while sitting in common hall. I talk to my mom at least once or twice a day everyday. I love my family soo much.<br>
		After lunch, when I was returning from mess , my super senior <b>Rajat Sir</b> and his friends stopped me and told to give my introduction. I was mild anger that why should I get introduced to a stranger. But they replied me politely that you should respect seniors and told me many rules which I had to follow while being as fresher in hostel. Later I apologise them and answered their every questions. After about 20 minutes conversation they let me go.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>25 Aug 2017, Friday</h2>
		On that day when I went college, I saw a girl in my class. I hadn‚Äôt noticed her in last days. She was damn beautiful and attractive. Her name was <b>Shivangi Dubey</b> (I asked her name to <b>Siddharth</b>). I was slightly attracted towards her but later I realised that she is girlfriend of our current Class Representative <b>Rohit Yadav</b>. I swear on my mother, after realising that she have boyfriend I never look at her and I didn‚Äôt see her that way. Her Roll Number is after mine i.e. 49, and she is also in my lab group. Our lab group is named S group because every members of our group are named by ‚ÄòS‚Äô, they are <b>Shiv Kumar, Shivangi Dubey, Shivani Rai, Shruti Mishra & Siddharth Mishra</b>.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>01 Sept 2017, Friday</h2>
		<img class="ph" src="Photos/8.jpeg">
		On that day I made my first appearance on Social Media. I downloaded WhatsApp, because every assignments and class information was provided through it. I contacted CR after the class told to add me to the college WhatsApp group and he did it.<br>
		On the same day my younger brother <b>Aashu (Aashish)</b> came there to meet me. My brother is my best friend. We studied in the same class from beginning to 12th and also we do everything together from studying, eating, playing to doing craziness. He also got admission in Ashoka Institute, Varanasi in same year in Bio Technology course (He had chosen PCB in intermediate). <b>Aashu</b> stayed here for 2 days and went back his college on 3rd Sept morning.

	<div>
		<h2>03 Sept 2017, Monday</h2>
		<img class="ph" src="Photos/9.jpg">
		In CAEG (Computer Aided Engineering Graphics) class that day, we were sitting roll number wise. Here I met my best friend in college <b>Shiv Kumar</b>. He was also our mess in charge of first floor. He is my best friend now, We sit together in the class and my roll number is next to him so we also sit in the exam together. Now we (I and <b>Shiv Kumar</b>) do everything by discussing each other. Before coming college, we discuss everything like- <i>‚ÄòAre today‚Äôs lectures worth it or not‚Äô, ‚ÄòAre you coming college or not‚Äô, ‚ÄòHave you done homework or not‚Äô, ‚ÄòHave you put the lecture notes or not‚Äô blah blah blah‚Ä¶</i> . He is not my roommate neither in hostel nor in Tirwa but he shares to me everything and also ask about everything when he is going to buy something that which thing should he buy and which is not. I can say that he is the brother from another motherüòç.<br>
		I also make some more friends in the next few days, they are <b>Abhishek Patel, Parimal Srivastava, Umar Singh and Prince Kr Gupta</b> from my class and <b>Satyam Singh, Neeraj, Shiv Shakti, Saurabh Kushwaha</b> and many more in the hostel. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>05 Sept 2017, Tuesday</h2>
		From that day our fresher party‚Äôs audition had started. Fresher Party was decided to be held on 16th September. Neither I know how to dance nor I am good in singing. So I decided to take part in Fashion Show, I went for audition but I was rejected because of my small height üòû. I was sad but what could I do so I forgot it.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>13 Sept 2017, Wednesday</h2>
		It was special day for me- ‚ÄúThat day was my birthday üéÇ‚Äù. I got many phone calls early in the morning from my parents, brother, sister, bhaiya, mama ji and mausi ji. It was my first birthday which I was not celebrating with my family. But friends are family in the hostel, my roommates <b>Prateek, Saurabh and Rohit</b> along with other friends went Tirwa, brought birthday cake and in the evening after playing Volleyball, I cut cake and celebrate my birthday. At that time, I had only a few friends but my room was full of about 40 boys. I don‚Äôt know half of them but they were in my room. I enjoyed very much.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>16 Sept 2017, Saturday</h2>
		<img src="Photos/10.jpg">
		Finally, it was the day means Fresher Party day. Our dress code was white shirt and black pant without belt. We all become fresh and dressed well for the party before the time. When the whole hostel was going towards college in same dress, it was awesome to see. It was started about 5:00 pm and at about 9:00 director ma‚Äôam told to stop because she didn‚Äôt want late night party. There were many students who participated in different songs, dances, skit, stand up and fashion show. At the end, Mr. & Miss fresher was announced. <b>Shivangi Dubey</b> and <b>Mani kiran</b> became Miss and Mr. Fresher respectively. We enjoyed very much, clicked many photos and eat different dishes.<br>
		I also found that my roommate <b>Saurabh</b> is more toxic than <b>Prateek</b> and he also used to Smoke and Drink. He told me before about that but I had never seen him. Saurabh, some hostellers and some seniors drunk in room no 209 that day. <b><i>I also want to mention that I never smoke and drink and also never want to do so.</i></b>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>25 Sept 2017, Monday</h2>
		Our first class test had started that day. As we had 5 subjects so it was scheduled to 2 subjects per day and continued to three days. First test experience in college was very good because I had got best marks in C Programming, Engineering Mathematics and also got highest marks in Engineering Mechanics subject in the class. Those were NAVRATRI days and there was holiday after exams so we could go to home after class test. I phone called dad and told him for train ticket reservation.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>27 Sept 2017, Wednesday</h2>
		Our CTs were over till 12:00 pm and train was at 2:30 pm from Kannauj. We had two tickets one for me and another for <b>Prateek</b>. <b>Shiv Shakti</b> told that he also had to go home. Then he also came with us without reservation. <b>Shiv Shakti</b> is also from Ballia but his parents live at Gorakhpur. <b>First when I met Prateek, I thought that I will not make him friend but my mind changes with time and now he is my roommate in Tirwa also.</b><br>
		It was my first journey to home after coming college. Our journey started and we reached at Lucknow at about 8:00 pm and arrived at Ballia at 6:00am. <b>Prateek</b> had to go Azamgarh so he reached there at 4:00am. TTE didn‚Äôt come to check tickets before MAU Station. TTE asked <b>Shiv Shakti</b> for ticket and he told that he doesn‚Äôt have .TTE fined him and warned to not do so.  When I told him that he had done mistake, he would not have replied before me because I had two reserved seats till Ballia. Then he realised that he should not replied too early to TTE.

		<h2>03 Oct 2017, Tuesday</h2>
		I came back to hostel after celebrating NAVRATRI & DASHARA Pooja. We three <b>(Me, Shiv Shakti & Prateek)</b> came together. I also brought my new brand new 4G phone from home. Till then I had  <b>Micromax Canvas 3G phone</b>.<br>
		I also did my first mistake in college that day. <b>Prateek</b> was gifted A Coffee Mug from someone, he put it below my bed, When I was getting out of bed, it cracked slightly from top. He was slightly angry upon me for that. But it was not only my mistake; he should not have put the mug below the bed.<br>

		<h2>06 Oct 2017, Friday</h2>
		<img src="Photos/11.jpg">
		There was much problem of electricity, drinking water in hostel and also there were a lot of insects during night. When we woke up that day, we saw that there was no water to bath and become fresh. It was not first time it has happened before also. So hostel students started protesting against the hostel administration. We were very yearning for water to bath so some of students including me had gone outside the college to bath. When we were coming back then there were press reporters in our college and they clicked our photo. The photo given below was published in the newspaper.<br>
		Usually at night there was no electricity, then after dinner we all friends group <b>(Me, Prateek, Saurabh, Satyam Singh, Vivekanand, Shiv Shakti, and many more)</b> went to college campus and spent time there, play ‚ÄúMINI MILITIA‚Äù, play ‚ÄúHIDE & SEEK‚Äù and do some fun stuff.  Because of electricity problem, I ordered a 20000mAh Power Bank. I also ordered Yonex Carbonex 7000 Badminton racket. I had missed my racquet at home so I bought it. <b>I, Prateek, Siddharth, Himanshu sir (senior) and Kritika (CS student)</b> used to play Badminton daily at Auditorium when we were in first year. <b>Siddharth</b> was very good in Badminton. Now <b>Siddharth</b> is not with us at our college, he had left the college after second semester and got admission in IIIT Manipur.

I was spectating them from corridor, and then <b>Shiv Kumar</b> and <b>Satya Prakash</b> came to take me on ground, I went for 5 minutes and came back to room because it was very cold outside and there was birthday of one of our neighbour student. Few seconds before New Year, everyone had started count down. Exactly at 12 AM, we all chanted together ‚ÄòHappy New Year‚Äô.  When party ended we got cold drink, sweet and snack as refreshment.
