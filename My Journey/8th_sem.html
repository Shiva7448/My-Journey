	<h1>MyFour Year Journey in REC Kannauj</h1>

	<h3>Welcome to my eighth or final semester journey.....</h3>

	
	<div>
		<h2>05 Apr 2021, Monday</h2>
		Our registration for even semester was going on in the college by offline mode. I am unable to go college due to some reasons. I had already printed out application form and other required documents and filled up the form and has given to <b>Shiv Kumar</b>. He along with <b>Sagar, Kamendra and Umar Singh</b> had gone to college today and submitted the forms of our entire friend circle. There are only three theory subjects in this last semester of our Bachelor‚Äôs. The subjects are- <i>‚ÄúRenewable Energy Resources, Electronic Switching and Wireless & Mobile Communication‚Äù</i>. There is also a major project in this semester but our teachers had told in last semester that we had to make only a big project which will continue in this semester also. <b>Prince</b> and I had completed the frontend of the e- Commerce website and we will complete the backend and database part in this semester.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>12 Apr 2021, Monday</h2>
		One notification came from our college that in this semester also our all classes will be online due to rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in our country. The second wave of the COVID-19 has become more deadly, more than hundred thousand cases came today in India only. There is also going to be lockdown across India. We had not to go college daily but doubt classes will be held at our college regularly after an interval of days. Like last year, we had to stay at home after came home to celebrate Holi. This COVID-19 virus is destroying our college life by packing us within our home.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>07- 09 Jun 2021</h2>
		Our first class tests of this semester were held in these spans of time. We have only three subjects in this semester so there was only one test per day. Though we all are at our home so the tests were in online mode via Google forms or classroom app.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>18 Jun 2021, Friday</h2>
		Today AKTU has informed us about the even semester examination details. AKTU have decided that the exam will be in online mode. They will develop a software for the exam. Students can take exam from their home or from any cybercaf√© via mobile/ laptop/ desktop. There will be 50 multiple choice questions in every exam and out of 4 options there will only one correct answer. There will not be any negative marks for wrong answers.  They will also hold a mock test before exam to help us to understand about the particular software and learn exam procedures. University have also informed us that the date sheet and admit card will be made available at least 15 days before examination. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>22 Jun 2021, Tuesday</h2>
		There was our project presentation today. I am the leader of our project group and my group members are <b>Prince Kr Gupta, Shiv kumar, Sagar Maurya & Prabhat Kr Prajapati</b>. Our guide is our favourite teacher <b>Rajeev Sir</b>. Our presentation was scheduled to start from 10:00 AM but it had started slightly late. Our group is at eighth number so we had to wait till 3:00 PM for our turn.<br>
        When it was time for our presentation, <b>Ashwini Sir</b> took his guided student‚Äôs presentation first before ours. When we started present our project, he did not like our project, he said so much that our project is not level of B. Tech. We were making project on web development which is a specialization of computer science & engineering. Even some CSE students will not have made project as good as ours. Now, we have to change our project and choose new topic for future presentations. It is very disappointing thing. We have only about 20 days for the final submission of the project. We have to do a lot of hard work.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>15- 16 Jul 2021</h2>
		This was time for second class test. It had also happened via online mode. The questions in these tests are also MCQ type. This time the tests were of small duration 10 or 15 minutes each.<br>
        AKTU emailed us the ID and password for the exam yesterday. Our ID is our university roll number. It also sent us the URL link for mock test. We could log in and take mock test before 19th July between 10:00 am to 06:00 pm. I have taken the mock test today. There were 50 questions in it. All the questions were from aptitude and general knowledge. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>24- 28 Jul 2021</h2>
		The first exam was today and was of Renewable Energy Resources. I was ready with my laptop and phone an hour before the exam time. Our reporting time was 3:00 pm and exam was from 3:30 to 5:00 pm. Since our exams are of MCQ type I have only prepared the MCQ questions from internet and various sources. The first exam was easy and I had completed it in one hour and I submitted it ahead of time after asking the examiner.<br>
        The second exam was today (on 26th).  There a mess with me during exam. When I logged in for the exam, it was just buffering and exam did not start until 17 minutes. I was so scared and nervous that I would not be able to take the exam. I did phone call to AKTU helpline centre and told them about the problem, they asked me to log out and log in again. I did and at that time it was resolved then but it also happened at the time of submission.<br>
        The third exam was very hard as compared to previous two exams but I did maximum of questions. I was too busy to questions and I don‚Äôt know how soon time ran out. It was exam of <i>‚ÄúWireless & Mobile Communication‚Äù</i>. There was no problem today like last exam. There were only three subjects and all exams ended successfully.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>09 Aug 2021, Monday</h2>
		In this semester we have only two practical subjects. One of them is Seminar & GD and the other is Major Project.  I have chosen ‚Äú5G Technology‚Äù for my seminar. The seminar was being held since 3rd August and in the evening of 4th August it was my turn but due to slow internet network I was not able to give my presentation. I asked <b>Amit Sir</b> for presentation the next morning and on 5th I have presented my seminar.<br>
        There was final year project presentation today. We have changed our project from previous one to a new project named <i>‚ÄúStudent Resource Management System‚Äù</i>. We have discussed all the details and project related things from our guide. We were practicing since last three days for our presentation and we have divided everyone‚Äôs role for presentation for our comfort. The examiner who was taking the presentation complimented that our presentation and project was very good but he didn‚Äôt asked any cross question from our group members. Our presentation lasted for 25 minutes. Now we have to submit the hard copy of our project report in our college as soon as possible.

		<h2>17 Aug 2021, Tuesday</h2>
		<img class="ph1" src="Photos/45.jpg">
		Our result for even semester of final year students has been declared today. This time our exam was held online so many of students from my batch got better mark in this semester with respect to previous ones. I have got 845 marks including project and seminar marks out of total 1000 marks. We can also download our provisional degree certificate from AKTU‚Äôs website.  I have attached the photo of my degree certificate. My overall CGPA of the eight semesters is 7.70 which is equivalent to 77%. I have been awarded <b>1st Division</b> in my Bachelor of Technology from Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow üë®‚Äçüéì.

	<div>
		<h2>31 Aug 2021, Tuesday</h2>
		Today, I have got an email from ‚Äú<b>WIPRO Technologies Limited</b>‚Äù that I have been selected for Project Engineer profile üë®‚Äçüíª. I have given the exam on 30th January 2021. But I had got email of rejection after some days of the exam. I had given up the hope to get placed in WIPRO but suddenly on 17th June, I received an email from WIPRO that I have been shortlisted for the interview. They conducted the interview after our semester exam. My Technical Interview was on 10th August and HR Interview was on 23rd August. Today, I received the LOI (Letter of Intent). Now, I have to upload the documents for verification within 15 days and save my spot within the company. I have also given interview for Accenture and Infosys after clearing written test but result didn‚Äôt come by today.

	<b>‚ÄúThis is officially an end of my college life. Ending of our (2017-2021 batch students) college life was not very happy. Almost last one and half years of college (3 Semesters) had been ruined by this Chinese virus COID-19. We were locked at our home for this span of time. We dd not spend time at our college with friends to do more fun and parties. We did not even get a farewell party. We also did not even get a chance for final goodbye to our friends ater last exam‚Äù.</b>
