	<h1>My Four Year Journey in REC Kannauj</h1>

	<p>Hello World!,<br>
        My name is <b>‚ÄúShivam Singh‚Äù</b> and I want to share a summary of my college life experience, every major bad and good things happened to me and also the things happened around me during these four years. So let‚Äôs get started with my introduction.<br>
        	<img src="photos/1.jpeg" style="width: 24%; height: 24%; margin: 2% .5% 1% .5%;">
    	    <img src="photos/3.jpg" style="width: 24%; height: 24%; margin: 2% .5% 1% .5%;">
        	<img src="photos/2.jpeg" style="width: 24%; height: 24%; margin: 2% .5% 1% .5%;">
        	<img src="photos/4.jpg" style="width: 24%; height: 24%; margin: 2% .5% 1% .5%;">
        	<figcaption style="color: orangered; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">First one is me, then my younger sister, my parents and last one is my younger brother.</figcaption><br>
        I am a small height, shy (socially awkward and usually don‚Äôt talk much), follower of non-violence and forgiveness, fair but not much handsome boy from a village Jamalpur (Chakia) in Ballia (UP). There are 5 members in my family, my dad <b>(Rajeshwar Singh)</b>, my mom <b>(Sharmila Singh)</b>, younger brother <b>(Aashish Singh)</b>, younger sister <b>(Pratiksha)</b> and <b>I</b>. My dad is a Post Office Agent and my mom is house wife. I am eldest among my siblings. I am from Raju Rastogi (3 idiots) type family but our parents take care us like the royalty of Harry Potter. Ohh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gonna fimly never mind let‚Äôs go ahead. I passed my high school and intermediate from local CBSE School. After passing class 12th, I decided to do engineering because I like technology and computer. So I sit in the entrance exam of IIT (mains & advance) and UPSEE. I haven't gotten very good marks in IIT mains and also only qualifying marks in IIT Advance exam. Hence, I couldn‚Äôt get admission in IITs and NITs. Also I qualified UPSEE, so I got admission in <b>"RAJKIYA ENGINEERING COLLEGE KANNAUJ"</b> in <b>Electronics Engineering</b> branch in <b>2017-2021</b> batch. Today is <b>10 February 2019, Sunday</b>, I have recently got admission my 4th semester. Now at this time I have no assignments and lessons to learn. I was reading an article about Anne Frank on internet. I had read novel of her in class 10th, I liked her writing so I decided to write a book like her and started writing this autobiography.<br>
        I have never experienced the hostel life nor live without my parents before coming to college so I will specially describe how I am surviving here. I will write my day by day incident with the date like in Anne‚Äôs Diary and will also share pictures of some incidents. I will include here a summary of all major incidents happened with me during college. I will not mention anything from my family issues and matters which are not related from my college life, for that there will be another book. I am not a professional writer so if there is lack of writer‚Äôs feeling or if there are any grammatical and spelling mistakes, <b>Please pardon me!</b><br>
        Now let‚Äôs move towards the subject-matter, hope you will enjoy reading my journey....................<br>
